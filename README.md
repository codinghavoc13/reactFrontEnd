# React Front End

This is a fairly basic React front end site I built as part of watching some videos and learning how to work with React. There are two sections in place right now.

## Bootstrap Cheat Sheet

Not exactly a new, groundbreaking concept I know. This is a small collection of pages that display various features of Bootstrap, each of the pages are seperate components which are displayed one at a time based on a flag.

## Forum

An early version of a simple forum style chat room. The whole thing will have rooms to group posts, then all of the posts. Click on a post to view the post and the responses. Currently there is no data in the database so when you pull up the page you'll get a note that "Something went wrong" (I plan to add some test data in the next few days)
