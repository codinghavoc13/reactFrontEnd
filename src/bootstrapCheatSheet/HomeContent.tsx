            <h1>Bootstrap Cheat Sheet Home</h1>
            <p>This is a generally simple application. I use Bootstrap a lot in my web applications, as such, I frequently use the Bootstrap documents pages as reference when building tools, expecially when using something I haven't used extensively before.
            </p>
            <p>While working through a course on Udemy, I built a large, static, single page that included a large number of Bootstrap tools. However, as I added more and more, the page became very unwieldy. Since the course I was working on was a React course and I wanted to come up with a simple project to get live quickly, I decided to merge everything:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Create a React based application</li>
                <li>Using multiple components and react features</li>
                <li>With demonstrations of various Bootstrap features</li>
            </ul>
        </>
    )
